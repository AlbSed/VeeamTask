# VeeamTask

One-way synchronization script.

To start enter in terminal:

```
python main.py Source Replica main.log <interval in seconds>
```
  
I used only the native python libraries. 
You can use my custom folders for testing of implementation or insert relative or absolute paths to the new folders.
